    <h1>short description of the social credit system</h1>
    <p class="biggerfont">Social credit is a plage that was made in china. It is here to put humans on a leesh like dogs. and give governements a lot of controll over humans.<br>the way this crap works is by observing your every move and giving you an online note about how well you "Behave". <br>The only way you can get back those points is by blaming someone else for anything you see him "doing wrong" apparently for the governement.<br> if you run out of social credit points, things like a 1$ bread or any products whould start costing more like "1$ to 1.20$ for the same product", you won't be allowed to travel and many other restrictions.</p>

    <p class="biggerfont">in short, that chinese guy made hell out of citizens lives.</p>
    <p class="biggerfont">now, we don't want this in our countries, but if we keep behaving that ignorant and stupid, we might as well just turn out as china did.<br>then you can enjoy your life following orders like a vile dog.</p>
