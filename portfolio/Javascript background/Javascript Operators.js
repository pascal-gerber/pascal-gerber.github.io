//in javascript there are many basic operators such as

//Basic assigning

//we asign 20 to the variable first
var first = 20;

//the basic addition
var added = first + 20;

//the basic substraction
var substracted = first - 10;

//the basic multiplication
var multiplied = first * 2;

//the basic division
var divided = first / 2;

//the squaring
var squared = first ** 2;

//division but have the number left that cannot be divided
var modulus = first % 3;

//then we have the 2 commands that add one or remove one
//its a direct command tho
//add 1
first++

//substract 1
first--

console.log(added, " 20 + 20");
console.log(substracted, "20 - 10");
console.log(multiplied, "20 * 2");
console.log(divided, "20 / 2");
console.log(squared, "20 * 20 or 20 ** 2");
console.log(modulus, "20 - (3 * 6)");
