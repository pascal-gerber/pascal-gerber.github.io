//while all the variable types can interact with each other

//those commands can be used for printing out a result
//tho console.log can be seen on your browsers console.
//by Pressing F12 or "Ctrl + Shift + i" you open the viewer
//then select the console

//alert doesn't require a console, it will simply pop up on the top
alert(allThree)
//or
console.log(allThree)
